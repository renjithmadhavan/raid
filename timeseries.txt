Simulate the white noise model
A weak white noise process has: ● A ﬁxed, constant mean ● A ﬁxed, constant variance ● No correlation over time
The white noise (WN) model is a basic time series model. It is also a basis for the more elaborate models we will consider. We will focus on the simplest form of WN, independent and identically distributed data.The arima.sim() function can be used to simulate data from a variety of time series models. ARIMA is an abbreviation for the autoregressive integrated moving average class of models we will consider throughout this course. An ARIMA(p, d, q) model has three parts, the autoregressive order p, the order of integration (or differencing) d, and the moving average order q. We will detail each of these parts soon, but for now we note that the ARIMA(0, 0, 0) model, i.e., with all of these components zero, is simply the WN model.

# Simulate a WN model with list(order = c(0, 0, 0))
white_noise <- arima.sim(model = list(order = c(0, 0, 0)), n = 100)
# Plot your white_noise data
ts.plot(white_noise)
# Simulate from the WN model with: mean = 100, sd = 10
white_noise_2 <- arima.sim(model = list(order = c(0, 0, 0)), n = 100, mean = 100, sd = 10)
# Plot your white_noise_2 data
ts.plot(white_noise_2)


Estimate the white noise model
# Fit the WN model to y using the arima command
arima(y, order=c(0, 0, 0))
# Calculate the sample mean and sample variance of y
mean(y)
var(y)


A random walk has: ● No speciﬁed mean or variance ● Strong dependence over time ● Its changes or increments are white noise (WN)
Simulate the random walk model
# Generate a RW model using arima.sim
random_walk <- arima.sim(model = list(order=c(0, 1, 0)), n = 100)
# Plot random_walk
ts.plot(random_walk)
# Calculate the first difference series
random_walk_diff <- diff(random_walk)
# Plot random_walk_diff
ts.plot(random_walk_diff)

Simulate the random walk model with a drift
# Generate a RW model with a drift uing arima.sim
rw_drift <- arima.sim(model = list(order=c(0,1,0)), n = 100, mean = 1)
# Plot rw_drift
ts.plot(rw_drift)
# Calculate the first difference series
rw_drift_diff <- diff(rw_drift)
# Plot rw_drift_diff
ts.plot(rw_drift_diff)

Estimate the random walk model
# Difference your random_walk data
rw_diff <- diff(random_walk)
# Plot rw_diff
ts.plot(rw_diff)
# Now fit the WN model to the differenced data
model_wn <- arima(x = rw_diff, order = c(0, 0, 0))
# Store the value of the estimated time trend (intercept)
int_wn <- model_wn$coef
# Plot the original random_walk data
ts.plot(random_walk)
# Use abline(0, ...) to add time trend to the figure
abline(0, int_wn)


Are the white noise model or the random walk model stationary?
# Use arima.sim() to generate WN data
white_noise <- arima.sim(model = list(order = c(0, 0, 0)), n = 100)
# Use cumsum() to convert your WN data to RW
random_walk <- cumsum(white_noise)
# Use arima.sim() to generate WN drift data
wn_drift <- arima.sim(model = list(order = c(0, 0, 0)), n = 100, mean = 0.4)
# Use cumsum() to convert your WN drift data to RW
rw_drift <- cumsum(wn_drift)
# Plot all four data objects
plot.ts(cbind(white_noise, random_walk, wn_drift, rw_drift))

Asset prices vs. asset returns
# Plot eu_stocks
plot(eu_stocks)
# Use this code to convert prices to returns
returns <- eu_stocks[-1,] / eu_stocks[-1860,] - 1
# Convert returns to ts
returns <- ts(returns, start = c(1991, 130), frequency = 260)
# Plot returns
plot(returns)
# Use this code to convert prices to log returns
logreturns <- diff(log(eu_stocks))
# Plot logreturns
plot(logreturns)


Characteristics of financial time series
# Generate means from eu_percentreturns
colMeans(eu_percentreturns)
# Use apply to calculate sample variance from eu_percentreturns
apply(eu_percentreturns, MARGIN = 2, FUN = var)
# Use apply to calculate standard deviation from eu_percentreturns
apply(eu_percentreturns, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sd)
# Display a histogram of percent returns for each index
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
apply(eu_percentreturns, MARGIN = 2, FUN = hist, main = "", xlab = "Percentage Return")
# Display normal quantile plots of percent returns for each index
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
apply(eu_percentreturns, MARGIN = 2, FUN = qqnorm, main = "")
qqline(eu_percentreturns)

# Use cov() with logreturns
cov(logreturns)
# Use cor() with DAX_logreturns and FTSE_logreturns
cor(DAX_logreturns, FTSE_logreturns)
# Use cor() with logreturns
cor(logreturns)


Calculating Auto Correlations

x_t0 <- x[-1]
# Define x_t1 as x[-n]
x_t1 <- x[-n]
# Confirm that x_t0 and x_t1 are (x[t], x[t-1]) pairs  
head(cbind(x_t0, x_t1))
# Plot x_t0 and x_t1
plot(x_t0, x_t1)
# View the correlation between x_t0 and x_t1
cor(x_t0, x_t1)
# Use acf with x
acf(x, lag.max = 1, plot = FALSE)
# Confirm that difference factor is (n-1)/n
cor(x_t1, x_t0) * (n-1)/n
# Generate ACF estimates for x up to lag-10
acf(x, lag.max = 10, plot = FALSE)

# View the ACF of x
acf(x)
# View the ACF of y
acf(y)
# View the ACF of z
acf(z)
