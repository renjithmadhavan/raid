gather() rearranges the data frame by specifying the columns that are categorical variables with a - notation. 
Complete the command. Notice that only one variable is categorical in iris.
separate() splits up the new key column, which contains the former headers, according to .. 
The new column names "Part" and "Measure" are given in a character vector. Don't forget the quotes.

# Load the tidyr package
library(tidyr)

# Fill in the ___ to produce to the correct iris.tidy dataset
iris.tidy <- iris %>%
  gather(key, Value, -Species) %>%
  separate(key, c("Part", "Measure"), "\\.")
